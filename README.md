# GoldmanSachsIncomingHiresHackathon
Goldman Sachs Incoming Campus Hires 2020 Hackathon Project

Project developed as part of Goldman Sachs first Incoming Campus Hires Hackathon. 

Project Title: PreTrade Optimization and Portfolio Based News Feed

We wanted to explore how we could make the wide variety of financial services that GS offers less opaque to the average user:
-Moving in a similar direction as the Marcus app, we leveraged the Marquee API in order to assist a wider range of people in accessing GS financial services. 
-As you may know, building a strong and diverse portfolio can be an overwhelming task. 
-By developing tools that are easy to understand and pleasurable to use, this makes financial decisions less confusing and stressful.
-This inevitably increases the range of clients accessible to GS. 

The Risk Optimization Tool we developed allows both new investors and seasoned veterans to make quicker, more iformed and up to date financial decisions, all from their handheld device. 

PreTrade Optimization Feature:
-The information returned by Goldman's API is great for highly trained analysts and traders but can be overwhelming for the average trader (and even interns for that matter).
-Thus we decided to use the information to calculate the essential financial report that an everyday trader might find insightful when making quick trading decisions. 

Used PreTrade Optimization API's response data to calculate and present to the user:
1. Expected Return of Asset as evaluated by CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)
2. Systematic Risk of Asset as presented by Beta Value (Historical Beta and current Beta)
3. Return on Common Equity using Live Data
